```

Here's a **complete explanation** of your `TimeTransactions` smart contract ‚Äî with **comments, purpose, and behavior of each part of the code**, to help you fully understand what's going on.

---

### üìÑ **1. Header and Compiler Version**

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

```

- `SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED`: Code isn't open-source under any specific license.
- `pragma`: Uses Solidity compiler version 0.8.20 or higher.

---

### üß± **2. Contract Declaration**

```solidity

contract TimeTransactions {

```

Defines the contract named `TimeTransactions`.

---

### üì¶ **3. Structs and Enums**

### Transaction Structure

```solidity

struct Transaction {
    address creator;          // Sender of the transaction
    address recipient;        // Intended recipient
    uint256 amount;           // Main amount to send
    uint256 createdAt;        // When transaction was created
    uint256 executionTime;    // Scheduled future time to execute
    uint256 tip;              // Bonus to executor
    Status status;            // Current status
    uint256 transactionFee;   // 1% fee
}

```

### Transaction Status

```solidity

enum Status {
    Pending,
    Executed,
    Reverted
}

```

Used to track whether a transaction is still waiting (`Pending`), completed (`Executed`), or cancelled (`Reverted`).

---

### üì£ **4. Events**

```solidity

event TransactionCreated(...);
event TransactionReverted(...);
event TransactionExecuted(...);
event FundsWithdrawn(...);

```

These log events help external applications (like frontends or indexers) know when a transaction was:

- Created
- Reverted
- Executed
- Admin withdrew contract fees

---

### üßæ **5. State Variables**

```solidity

mapping(uint256 => Transaction) public transactions;
uint256 public transactionCount;
uint256 public totalExecutedTransactionFees;
address public admin;

```

- `transactions`: Stores all transactions by their ID.
- `transactionCount`: Number of transactions created.
- `totalExecutedTransactionFees`: Sum of 1% fees collected from executed transactions (admin can withdraw this).
- `admin`: The contract owner/admin (who can withdraw fees).

---

### üîê **6. Access Control Modifier**

```solidity

modifier onlyAdmin {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can call this function");
    _;
}

```

Ensures only the `admin` address can execute certain functions.

---

### üèó **7. Constructor**

```solidity

constructor() {
    admin = msg.sender;
}

```

Sets the **deployer** of the contract as the `admin`.

---

### ‚ûï **8. Creating a Timed Transaction**

```solidity

function createTransaction(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, uint256 _executionTime, uint256 _tip) external payable

```

### Purpose:

Schedules a transaction for future execution.

### Logic:

1. Requires a valid recipient and a time in the future.
2. Calculates a **1% transaction fee**.
3. Verifies that `msg.value` equals `amount + tip + fee`.
4. Saves transaction with `Pending` status.

```solidity

emit TransactionCreated(...);

```

Logs the transaction creation.

---

### üîÅ **9. Reverting a Pending Transaction**

```solidity

function RevertTransaction(uint256 _transactionId) external

```

### Purpose:

Allows the creator to **cancel** their own transaction if it's **still pending** and **before execution time**.

### Logic:

- Checks the sender is the creator.
- Verifies the transaction hasn‚Äôt been executed.
- Refunds full value (`amount + tip + fee`).
- Updates status to `Reverted`.
- Emits event.

---

### ‚úÖ **10. Executing the Transaction**

```solidity

function ExecuteTransaction(uint256 _transactionId) external

```

### Purpose:

Allows **any user except the recipient** to execute the transaction **after the scheduled time**.

### Logic:

- Checks it's still `Pending` and `block.timestamp >= executionTime`.
- Transfers:
    - `amount` to `recipient`
    - `tip` to `executor` (as a reward)
- Adds the fee to `totalExecutedTransactionFees`.
- Marks status as `Executed`.
- Emits event.

---

### üßÆ **11. Calculate Transaction Fee**

```solidity

function calculateTransactionFee(uint256 amount) internal pure returns (uint256)

```

Returns a 1% fee of the amount.

---

### üí∏ **12. Admin Withdraws Fees**

```solidity

function withdrawTransactionFees(uint256 _amount) external onlyAdmin

```

Allows the admin to withdraw only the **accumulated 1% fees** from **executed transactions**.

---

### üëÄ **13. View Contract Balance**

```solidity

function getContractBalance() external view onlyAdmin returns (uint256)

```

Returns only the withdrawable **executed transaction fees**, not full contract balance.

---

### üîç **14. Get a Specific Transaction**

```solidity

function getTransaction(uint256 _transactionId) external view returns (...)

```

Returns core transaction data for a specific ID.

---

### üìÜ **15. Get Transactions Within a Date Range**

```solidity

function getTransactionsByDateRange(uint256 startTimestamp, uint256 endTimestamp)

```

Returns a list of transactions created between `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp`.

If both inputs are `0`, it returns **all transactions**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **16. Fallback Function**

```solidity

receive() external payable {}

```

Allows the contract to **receive ETH directly**, though it doesn't affect any functionality here.
