### Create ERC-20 token with 10,000 total supply and send 5000 tokens to other address.

Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.0.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import {ERC20Permit} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20, ERC20Permit {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") ERC20Permit("MyToken") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 10000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}

```

In this project ERC-20 is imported from openZeppelin. So you have to folder where you want to start your contract and install this:

- forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
- Open foundry.toml and add there:
    1.  remappings= ["@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/”]

Now For the deployment 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/MyToken.sol";

contract DeployScript is Script {
    function run() external {

        // Start broadcasting using the private key
        vm.startBroadcast();

        // Deploy MyToken contract
        MyToken token = new MyToken();

        // Transfer 5000 tokens to the senior's address
        address seniorAddress = replace with actual address;
        token.transfer(seniorAddress, 5000 * 10 ** token.decimals());

        // Log addresses
        console.log("Token deployed to:", address(token));
        console.log("Tokens transferred to:", seniorAddress);

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}

```

Here in the senior address you have to write the address where you want to send tokens.

i deployed this in Sepolia testnet. So to deploy this in Sepolia, this is the method i follow:

- Make a app in alchemy and choose Sepolia to get RPC_URL.
- Create a Metamask account to get a PRIVATE_KEY.
- Make a .env file in folder where my contract is.
- Then type source .env in terminal
- Then deploy using forge script/deploy.s.sol(yoyr deploy file name) —rpc-url $RPC_URL —private-key $PRIVATE_KEY —broadcast


ERC-20 tokens, while widely used, have several known vulnerabilities that developers need to be aware of to ensure the security of their smart contracts. Here are some of the most common vulnerabilities:

### 1. **Integer Overflow and Underflow**

**Description**: This occurs when a mathematical operation results in a number that is outside the range of the variable type, causing unexpected behavior.
**Example**: Adding two large numbers together might wrap around and produce a very small number.

### 2. **Reentrancy Attacks**

**Description**: This happens when a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first execution is finished, potentially draining funds.
**Example**: The infamous DAO attack exploited this vulnerability to siphon off millions of dollars worth of Ether.

### 3. **Batch Overflow**

**Description**: This vulnerability allows attackers to create an excessive amount of tokens by exploiting the `batchTransfer` function.
**Example**: The BeautyChain (BEC) and MeshBox (MESH) tokens were exploited using this vulnerability.

### 4. **Unprotected Functions**

**Description**: Functions that do not have proper access control can be called by anyone, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
**Example**: A token contract with an unprotected `mint` function can be exploited to create an unlimited number of tokens.

### 5. **Incorrect Implementation of** `transfer` **and** `transferFrom`

**Description**: Incorrectly implementing these functions can lead to vulnerabilities such as allowing unauthorized transfers or failing to emit events.
**Example**: A token contract that does not properly check the sender's allowance before executing a `transferFrom` can be exploited.

### 6. **Front-Running**

**Description**: This occurs when a transaction is observed by miners and included in a block before a pending transaction, potentially leading to unfair advantages.
**Example**: An attacker might observe a pending token sale and place a buy order before the sale, driving up the price.

### 7. **Denial of Service (DoS)**

**Description**: Certain functions or conditions can be exploited to make the contract unresponsive or unusable.
**Example**: A contract with a function that causes an infinite loop can be used to block legitimate transactions.

### 8. **Logic Errors**

**Description**: Mistakes in the contract logic can lead to unintended behavior.
**Example**: A token contract that incorrectly calculates balances can result in incorrect token distributions.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, developers should:

- **Use Established Libraries**: Utilize well-tested libraries like OpenZeppelin for ERC-20 token implementation.
- **Conduct Thorough Audits**: Have the contract code audited by security experts.
- **Implement Access Control**: Ensure that sensitive functions are protected by access control mechanisms.
- **Test Extensively**: Perform comprehensive testing, including unit tests and integration tests, to catch potential issues.
