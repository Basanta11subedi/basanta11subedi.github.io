### ‚úÖ **License & Version**

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

```

- Declares the open-source license (MIT).

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```

- Requires Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.
- Ensures compatibility and access to the latest features and safety improvements.

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Contract Declaration**

```solidity

contract Crowdfunding {

```

- Defines a contract named `Crowdfunding`.

---

### üß± **Struct: Campaign**

```solidity

struct Campaign {
    address payable creator;
    string title;
    string description;
    string evidence;
    uint fundingGoal;
    uint deadline;
    uint amountRaised;
    bool isCompleted;
    mapping(address => uint) contributions;
}

```

Defines the structure for a single campaign:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `creator` | `address payable` | Campaign owner, allowed to receive funds. |
| `title` | `string` | Campaign title. |
| `description` | `string` | Description of the campaign. |
| `evidence` | `string` | Proof or evidence (e.g., IPFS link, image URL). |
| `fundingGoal` | `uint` | Funding target in wei. |
| `deadline` | `uint` | Campaign end time (timestamp). |
| `amountRaised` | `uint` | Amount contributed so far. |
| `isCompleted` | `bool` | True once funds have been withdrawn. |
| `contributions` | `mapping` | Tracks how much each address has contributed. |

üß† Note: `mapping` inside a `struct` cannot be returned directly ‚Äî it‚Äôs internal storage only.

---

### üì¶ **Global Variables**

```solidity

address public owner;
uint public campaignCount;
uint public totalFeesCollected;
mapping(uint => Campaign) public campaigns;

```

- `owner`: Contract deployer; can withdraw platform fees.
- `campaignCount`: Tracks number of campaigns.
- `totalFeesCollected`: 2% fee from campaigns.
- `campaigns`: Maps a campaign ID (`uint`) to its data (`Campaign` struct).

---

### üì£ **Events**

```solidity

event CampaignCreated(...);
event ContributionMade(...);
event FundsWithdrawn(...);
event ContractFeeWithdrawn(...);

```

These allow external interfaces (like dApps) to listen for changes:

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CampaignCreated` | Triggered when a new campaign is made. |
| `ContributionMade` | Logs a new contribution. |
| `FundsWithdrawn` | Logs fund withdrawal by a creator. |
| `ContractFeeWithdrawn` | Logs withdrawal of contract fees by the owner. |

---

### üîê **Access Control Modifiers**

```solidity

modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can perform this action");
    _;
}

```

- Restricts a function to the contract `owner`.

```solidity

modifier isCampaignActive(uint _campaignId) {
    Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[_campaignId];
    require(block.timestamp < campaign.deadline, "Campaign deadline passed");
    require(!campaign.isCompleted, "Campaign is completed");
    _;
}

```

- Ensures a campaign is **still running** before allowing contributions.

---

### üèÅ **Constructor**

```solidity

constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}

```

- Sets the contract deployer as `owner`.

---

### üÜï **Function: `createCampaign(...)`**

```solidity

function createCampaign(...) external { ... }

```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_title` | string | Campaign name. |
| `_description` | string | Campaign details. |
| `_evidence` | string | Link or hash to proof (images, documents). |
| `_fundingGoal` | uint | Minimum funding target in wei. |
| `_duration` | uint | Campaign length in seconds. |

Steps:

- Validates goal and duration.
- Initializes a new campaign in the `campaigns` mapping.
- Emits `CampaignCreated`.

---

### üí∏ **Function: `contribute(...)`**

```solidity

function contribute(uint _campaignId) external payable isCampaignActive(_campaignId)

```

- Requires payment (`payable`) and checks if the campaign is active.
- Verifies non-zero contribution and funding goal isn't already reached.
- Adds contribution to campaign‚Äôs `amountRaised`.
- Tracks how much each sender contributed.
- Emits `ContributionMade`.

---

### üè¶ **Function: `withdrawFunds(...)`**

```solidity

function withdrawFunds(uint _campaignId) external

```

Only callable by campaign **creator** if:

- Campaign is **complete** (deadline passed or goal reached).
- Campaign not already withdrawn.

**Fee Structure:**

- 2% platform fee taken from total raised.
- Remaining 98% sent to the creator using `call{value: ...}` (modern recommended pattern).

**Updates:**

- Marks campaign as `isCompleted = true`.
- Adds fee to `totalFeesCollected`.
- Emits `FundsWithdrawn`.

---

### üßæ **Function: `withdrawContractFees()`**

```solidity

function withdrawContractFees() external onlyOwner

```

- Lets contract `owner` collect accumulated 2% fees.
- Uses `call` to transfer fees.
- Emits `ContractFeeWithdrawn`.

---

### üîç **Function: `getCampaignDetails(...)`**

```solidity

function getCampaignDetails(...) external view returns (...)

```

Returns read-only information about a campaign, excluding internal mappings:

- `creator`
- `title`
- `description`
- `evidence`
- `fundingGoal`
- `deadline`
- `amountRaised`
- `isCompleted`

Useful for front-end UIs.
