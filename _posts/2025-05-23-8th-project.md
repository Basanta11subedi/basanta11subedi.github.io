## 🔐 Contract Overview

### 🔧 Purpose

This contract enables:

- Adding/removing employees.
- Recording **arrival and departure times**.
- Applying penalties for **lateness or early departure**.
- Paying salaries based on base salary, incentives, and penalties.

---

## 🧱 Struct Definitions

### `Employee`

```solidity

struct Employee {
    address walletAddress;
    uint256 baseSalary;
    uint256 totalIncentives;
    uint256 totalPenalties;
    bool isActive;
    mapping(uint256 => DailyRecord) dailyRecords;
    uint256 totalDailyRecords;
}

```

- Stores personal salary-related and attendance data.
- Uses a `mapping` for each employee's attendance (`dailyRecords`), indexed by a record count.

### `DailyRecord`

```solidity

struct DailyRecord {
    uint256 arrivalTime;
    uint256 departureTime;
    uint256 dailyPenalty;
    bool isLate;
    bool leftEarly;
}

```

- Logs daily attendance info: when the employee arrived/left and if penalties were applied.

---

## 🌐 Global State Variables

```solidity

address public owner;
mapping(address => Employee) public employees;
address[] public employeeAddresses;

```

- `owner`: Admin who manages employees and system settings.
- `employees`: Maps addresses to employee records.
- `employeeAddresses`: List of all employee addresses for iteration.

```solidity

uint256 public constant LATE_THRESHOLD = 5 minutes;
uint256 public constant DEPARTURE_THRESHOLD = 5 minutes;
uint256 public PENALTY_RATE_PER_MINUTE = 1000 wei;

```

- Penalty starts **only after 5 minutes delay**.
- Penalty rate is `1000 wei` per extra minute (configurable).

```solidity

uint256 public expectedArrivalTime;
uint256 public expectedDepartureTime;

```

- Target clock-in and clock-out times, set during deployment.

---

## 🔐 Access Control

### `modifier onlyOwner()`

Restricts access to contract owner functions (e.g., `addEmployee`).

### `modifier onlyActiveEmployee()`

Allows only registered and active employees to call functions like `recordArrival()`.

---

## 🏁 Constructor

```solidity

constructor(uint256 _expectedArrivalTime, uint256 _expectedDepartureTime)

```

- Initializes the contract and sets expected work times.

---

## 👷 Employee Management

### `addEmployee(...)`

Registers a new employee:

- Requires address is not already active.
- Initializes salary, sets employee as active.

### `removeEmployee(...)`

Marks employee as inactive (soft delete).

### `updateEmployeeSalary(...)`

Updates base salary for an employee.

### `addIncentive(...)`

Sets (or resets) incentive amount. **Overwrites previous value**, which could be a limitation.

---

## ⏱️ Attendance Tracking

### `recordArrival()`

Logs **arrival time** and calculates **lateness penalty**:

- If arrival is **later than expected**, subtracts 5-minute grace.
- Applies `PENALTY_RATE_PER_MINUTE`.
- Updates employee’s `totalPenalties` and attendance record.

### `recordDeparture()`

Logs **departure time** and calculates **early leave penalty**:

- Must be called *after arrival is recorded*.
- If leaving **earlier than expected**, subtracts 5-minute grace.
- Updates penalties and moves to the next daily record.

---

## 💵 Salary Calculation & Payment

### `paySalary()`

Transfers salary to employee:

- `finalSalary = baseSalary + incentives - penalties`.
- Uses `transfer()` (safe for fixed gas limits).
- Resets incentive and penalty amounts after payment.

---

## 📤 View Functions

### `getEmployeeDetails(address)`

Returns employee's status, salary, incentive, and penalty data.

### `getAllEmployees()`

Returns an array of all employee addresses.

---

## 🔂 Fallback Function

```solidity

receive() external payable {}

```

- Allows the contract to **receive Ether**, needed for salary payments.

---

## 📌 Key Design Observations

### ✅ Pros:

- Tracks attendance and salary on-chain.
- Penalizes tardiness or early departure with real Ether deductions.
- Incentives configurable by employer.
- Full audit trail via `DailyRecord`.
